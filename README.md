## Description

There are many simple text editor programs that exist out there. For this project, I wanted to take an existing application and set it up with a service worker and use indexedDB to make it installable on your local machine. It is now ready and able to be used offline as a Progressive Web Application. I ran into some difficulty with the data injection back onto the page but was able to fix it by changing the type of data I was passing in.
